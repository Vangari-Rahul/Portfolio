      Results-driven Senior Software Engineer with ~5 years of experience building
      and scaling enterprise-grade SaaS platforms.
      <br /><br />
      I specialize in frontend-heavy systems using JavaScript and Vue.js, with solid
      backend experience in Node.js and MySQL. I’ve worked on backend services handling
      large datasets, complex financial computations, and performance-sensitive workflows.
      <br /><br />
      I focus on clean system design, maintainability, and real business impact.
